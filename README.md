# Google-Colab-Notes
A list of resources on how to best use this wonderful free resource.

## What is it?
- Google Colab stands for Google Colaboratory.
- It is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs on Googleâ€™s cloud servers, letting the user leverage backend hardware like GPUs and TPUs.
- This lets you do everything you can in a Jupyter notebook hosted in your local machine, without requiring the installations and setup for hosting a notebook in your local machine.
***

## Limitations
- Colab is a temporary environment with an idle timeout of 90 minutes and an absolute timeout of 12 hours. This means that the runtime will disconnect if it has remained idle for 90 minutes, or if it has been in use for 12 hours. On disconnection, you lose all your variables, states, installed packages, and files and will be connected to an entirely new and clean environment on reconnecting.
- Also, Colab has a disk space limitation of 108 GB, of which only 77 GB is available to the user. While this should be enough for most tasks, keep this in mind while working with larger datasets like image or video data.
